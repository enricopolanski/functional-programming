# Applicative functors

In the section regarding functors we've seen that we can compose an effectful program `f: (a: A) => F<B>` with a pure one `g: (b: B) => C` through the transformation of `g` to a function `map(g): (fb: F<B>) => F<C>` (if and only if `F` admits a functor instance).

| Program f | Program g    | Composition  |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| pure      | pure         | `g ∘ f`      |
| effectful | pure (unary) | `map(g) ∘ f` |

But `g` has to be unary, it can only accept a single argument as input. What happens if `g` accepts two arguments? Can we still transform `g` using only the functor instance?

## Currying

First of all we need to model a function that accepts two arguments of type `B` and `C` (we can use a tuple for this) and returns a value of type `D`:

```ts
g: (b: B, c: C) => D
```

We can rewrite `g` using a technique called **currying**.

> Currying is the technique of translating the evaluation of a function that takes multiple arguments into evaluating a sequence of functions, **each with a single argument**. For example, a function that takes two arguments, one from `B` and one from `C`, and produces outputs in `D`, by currying is translated into a function that takes a single argument from `C` and produces as outputs functions from `B` to `C`.

(source: [currying on wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying))

Thus, through currying, we can rewrite `g` as:

```ts
g: (b: B) => (c: C) => D
```

**Example**

```ts
interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
  readonly followers: ReadonlyArray<User>
}

const addFollower = (follower: User, user: User): User => ({
  ...user,
  followers: [...user.followers, follower]
})
```

Let's refactor `addFollower` through currying

```ts
interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
  readonly followers: ReadonlyArray<User>
}

const addFollower = (follower: User) => (user: User): User => ({
  ...user,
  followers: [...user.followers, follower]
})

// -------------------
// usage example
// -------------------

const user: User = { id: 1, name: 'Ruth R. Gonzalez', followers: [] }
const follower: User = { id: 3, name: 'Marsha J. Joslyn', followers: [] }

console.log(addFollower(follower)(user))
/*
{
  id: 1,
  name: 'Ruth R. Gonzalez',
  followers: [ { id: 3, name: 'Marsha J. Joslyn', followers: [] } ]
}
*/
```

## The `ap` operation

Suppose that:

- we do not have a `follower` but only his `id`
- we do not have a `user` but only his `id`
- that we have an API `fetchUser` which, given an `id`, queries an endpoint that returns the corresponding `User`

```ts
import * as T from 'fp-ts/Task'

interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
  readonly followers: ReadonlyArray<User>
}

const addFollower = (follower: User) => (user: User): User => ({
  ...user,
  followers: [...user.followers, follower]
})

declare const fetchUser: (id: number) => T.Task<User>

const userId = 1
const followerId = 3

const result = addFollower(fetchUser(followerId))(fetchUser(userId)) // does not compile
```

I can't use `addFollower` anymore! How can we proceed?

If only we had a function with the following signature:

```ts
declare const addFollowerAsync: (
  follower: T.Task<User>
) => (user: T.Task<User>) => T.Task<User>
```

we could proceed with ease:

```ts
import * as T from 'fp-ts/Task'

interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
  readonly followers: ReadonlyArray<User>
}

declare const fetchUser: (id: number) => T.Task<User>

declare const addFollowerAsync: (
  follower: T.Task<User>
) => (user: T.Task<User>) => T.Task<User>

const userId = 1
const followerId = 3

// const result: T.Task<User>
const result = addFollowerAsync(fetchUser(followerId))(fetchUser(userId)) // now compiles
```

We can obviously implement `addFollowerAsync` manually, but is it possible instead to find a transformation which starting with a function like `addFollower: (follower: User) => (user: User): User` returns a function like `addFollowerAsync: (follower: Task<User>) => (user: Task<User>) => Task<User>`?

More generally what we would like to have is a transformation, call it `liftA2`, which beginning with a function `g: (b: B) => (c: C) => D` returns a function with the following signature:

```ts
liftA2(g): (fb: F<B>) => (fc: F<C>) => F<D>
```

<img src="images/liftA2.png" width="500" alt="liftA2" />

How can we obtain it? Given that `g` is now a unary function, we can leverage the functor instance and the good old `map`:

```ts
map(g): (fb: F<B>) => F<(c: C) => D>
```

<img src="images/liftA2-first-step.png" width="500" alt="liftA2 (first step)" />

Now we are blocked: there's no legal operation the functor instance provides us to "unpack" the type `F<(c: C) => D>` into `(fc: F<C>) => F<D>`.

We need to introduce a new operation `ap` which realizes this unpacking:

```ts
declare const ap: <A>(fa: Task<A>) => <B>(fab: Task<(a: A) => B>) => Task<B>
```

**Note**. Why is it names "ap"? Because it can be seen like some sort of function application.

```ts
// `apply` applies a function to a value
declare const apply: <A>(a: A) => <B>(f: (a: A) => B) => B

declare const ap: <A>(a: Task<A>) => <B>(f: Task<(a: A) => B>) => Task<B>
// `ap` applies a function wrapped into an effect to a value wrapped into an effect
```

Now that we have `ap` we can define `liftA2`:

```ts
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as T from 'fp-ts/Task'

const liftA2 = <B, C, D>(g: (b: B) => (c: C) => D) => (fb: T.Task<B>) => (
  fc: T.Task<C>
): T.Task<D> => pipe(fb, T.map(g), T.ap(fc))

interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
  readonly followers: ReadonlyArray<User>
}

const addFollower = (follower: User) => (user: User): User => ({
  ...user,
  followers: [...user.followers, follower]
})

// const addFollowerAsync: (fb: T.Task<User>) => (fc: T.Task<User>) => T.Task<User>
const addFollowerAsync = liftA2(addFollower)
```

and finally, we can compose `fetchUser` with the previous result:

```ts
import { flow, pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as T from 'fp-ts/Task'

const liftA2 = <B, C, D>(g: (b: B) => (c: C) => D) => (fb: T.Task<B>) => (
  fc: T.Task<C>
): T.Task<D> => pipe(fb, T.map(g), T.ap(fc))

interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
  readonly followers: ReadonlyArray<User>
}

const addFollower = (follower: User) => (user: User): User => ({
  ...user,
  followers: [...user.followers, follower]
})

declare const fetchUser: (id: number) => T.Task<User>

// const program: (id: number) => (fc: T.Task<User>) => T.Task<User>
const program = flow(fetchUser, liftA2(addFollower))

const userId = 1
const followerId = 3

// const result: T.Task<User>
const result = program(followerId)(fetchUser(userId))
```

We have found a standard procedure to compose two functions `f: (a: A) => F<B>`, `g: (b: B, c: C) => D`:

1. we transform `g` through currying in a function `g: (b: B) => (c: C) => D`
2. we define the `ap` function for the effect `F` (library function)
3. we define the utility function `liftA2` for the effect `F` (library function)
4. we obtain the composition `flow(f, liftA2(g))`

Let's see how's the `ap` operation implemented for some of the type constructors we've already seen:

**Example** (`F = ReadonlyArray`)

```ts
import { increment, pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'

const ap = <A>(fa: ReadonlyArray<A>) => <B>(
  fab: ReadonlyArray<(a: A) => B>
): ReadonlyArray<B> => {
  const out: Array<B> = []
  for (const f of fab) {
    for (const a of fa) {
      out.push(f(a))
    }
  }
  return out
}

const double = (n: number): number => n * 2

pipe([double, increment], ap([1, 2, 3]), console.log) // => [ 2, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4 ]
```

**Example** (`F = Option`)

```ts
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as O from 'fp-ts/Option'

const ap = <A>(fa: O.Option<A>) => <B>(
  fab: O.Option<(a: A) => B>
): O.Option<B> =>
  pipe(
    fab,
    O.match(
      () => O.none,
      (f) =>
        pipe(
          fa,
          O.match(
            () => O.none,
            (a) => O.some(f(a))
          )
        )
    )
  )

const double = (n: number): number => n * 2

pipe(O.some(double), ap(O.some(1)), console.log) // => some(2)
pipe(O.some(double), ap(O.none), console.log) // => none
pipe(O.none, ap(O.some(1)), console.log) // => none
pipe(O.none, ap(O.none), console.log) // => none
```

**Example** (`F = IO`)

```ts
import { IO } from 'fp-ts/IO'

const ap = <A>(fa: IO<A>) => <B>(fab: IO<(a: A) => B>): IO<B> => () => {
  const f = fab()
  const a = fa()
  return f(a)
}
```

**Example** (`F = Task`)

```ts
import { Task } from 'fp-ts/Task'

const ap = <A>(fa: Task<A>) => <B>(fab: Task<(a: A) => B>): Task<B> => () =>
  Promise.all([fab(), fa()]).then(([f, a]) => f(a))
```

**Example** (`F = Reader`)

```ts
import { Reader } from 'fp-ts/Reader'

const ap = <R, A>(fa: Reader<R, A>) => <B>(
  fab: Reader<R, (a: A) => B>
): Reader<R, B> => (r) => {
  const f = fab(r)
  const a = fa(r)
  return f(a)
}
```

We've seen how with `ap` we can manage functions with two parameters, but what happens with functions that take **three** parameters? Do we need _yet another abstraction_?

Good news is no, `map` and `ap` are sufficient:

```ts
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as T from 'fp-ts/Task'

const liftA3 = <B, C, D, E>(f: (b: B) => (c: C) => (d: D) => E) => (
  fb: T.Task<B>
) => (fc: T.Task<C>) => (fd: T.Task<D>): T.Task<E> =>
  pipe(fb, T.map(f), T.ap(fc), T.ap(fd))

const liftA4 = <B, C, D, E, F>(
  f: (b: B) => (c: C) => (d: D) => (e: E) => F
) => (fb: T.Task<B>) => (fc: T.Task<C>) => (fd: T.Task<D>) => (
  fe: T.Task<E>
): T.Task<F> => pipe(fb, T.map(f), T.ap(fc), T.ap(fd), T.ap(fe))

// etc...
```

Now we cam update ore "composition table":

| Program f | Program g     | Composition     |
| --------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| pure      | pure          | `g ∘ f`         |
| effectful | pure (unary)  | `map(g) ∘ f`    |
| effectful | pure, `n`-ary | `liftAn(g) ∘ f` |

## The `of` operation

Now we know that given two function `f: (a: A) => F<B>`, `g: (b: B, c: C) => D` we can obtain the composition `h`:

```ts
h: (a: A) => (fc: F<C>) => F<D>
```

To execute `h` we need a new value of type `A` and a value of type `F<C>`.

But what happens if, instead of having a value of type `F<C>`, for the second parameter `fc` we only have a value of type `C`?

It would be helpful to have an operation which can transform a value of type `C` in a value of type `F<C>` in order to use `h`.

Let's introduce such operation, called `of` (other synonyms: **pure**, **return**):

```ts
declare const of: <C>(c: C) => F<C>
```

In literature the term **applicative functors** is used for the type constructors which admith _both_ the `ap` and `of` operations.

Let's see how `of` is defined for some type constructors we've already seen:

**Example** (`F = ReadonlyArray`)

```ts
const of = <A>(a: A): ReadonlyArray<A> => [a]
```

**Example** (`F = Option`)

```ts
import * as O from 'fp-ts/Option'

const of = <A>(a: A): O.Option<A> => O.some(a)
```

**Example** (`F = IO`)

```ts
import { IO } from 'fp-ts/IO'

const of = <A>(a: A): IO<A> => () => a
```

**Example** (`F = Task`)

```ts
import { Task } from 'fp-ts/Task'

const of = <A>(a: A): Task<A> => () => Promise.resolve(a)
```

**Example** (`F = Reader`)

```ts
import { Reader } from 'fp-ts/Reader'

const of = <R, A>(a: A): Reader<R, A> => () => a
```

**Demo**

[`05_applicative.ts`](https://github.com/wwmmzz/functional-programming/blob/master/src/05_applicative.ts)

## Applicative functors compose

Applicative functors compose, meaning that given two applicative functors `F` and `G`, their composition `F<G<A>>` is still an applicative functor.

**Example** (`F = Task`, `G = Option`)

The `of` of the composition is the composition of the `of`s:

```ts
import { flow } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as O from 'fp-ts/Option'
import * as T from 'fp-ts/Task'

type TaskOption<A> = T.Task<O.Option<A>>

const of: <A>(a: A) => TaskOption<A> = flow(O.of, T.of)
```

the `ap` of the composition is obtained by the following pattern:

```ts
const ap = <A>(
  fa: TaskOption<A>
): (<B>(fab: TaskOption<(a: A) => B>) => TaskOption<B>) =>
  flow(
    T.map((gab) => (ga: O.Option<A>) => O.ap(ga)(gab)),
    T.ap(fa)
  )
```

## Do applicative functors solve the general problem?

Not yet. There's one last very important case to consider: when **both** programs are effectful.

Yet again we need something more, in the following chapter we'll talk about one of the most important abstractions in functional programming: **monads**.
