# Modeling composition through Monoids

Let's recap what we have seen till now.

We have seen how an **algebra** is a combination of:

- some type `A`
- some operations involving the type `A`
- some laws and properties for that combination.

The first algebra we have seen has been the magma, an algebra defined on some type A equipped with one operation called `concat`. There were no laws involved in `Magma<A>` the only requirement we had was that the `concat` operation had to be _closed_ on `A` meaning that the result:

```ts
concat(first: A, second: A) => A
```

has still to be an element of the `A` type.

Later on we have seen how adding one simple requirement, _associativity_, allowed some `Magma<A>` to be further refined as a `Semigroup<A>`, and how associativity captures the possibility of computations to be parallelized.

Now we're going to add another condition on Semigroup.

Given a `Semigroup` defined on some set `A` with some `concat` operation, if there is some element in `A` – we'll call this element _empty_ – such as for every element `a` in `A` the two following equations hold true:

- **Right identity**: `concat(a, empty) = a`
- **Left identity**: `concat(empty, a) = a`

then the `Semigroup` is also a `Monoid`.

**Note**: We'll call the `empty` element **unit** for the rest of this section. There's other synonyms in literature, some of the most common ones are _neutral element_ and _identity element_.

We have seen how in TypeScript `Magma`s and `Semigroup`s, can be modeled with `interface`s, so it should not come as a surprise that the very same can be done for `Monoid`s.

```ts
import { Semigroup } from 'fp-ts/Semigroup'

interface Monoid<A> extends Semigroup<A> {
  readonly empty: A
}
```

Many of the semigroups we have seen in the previous sections can be extended to become `Monoid`s. All we need to find is some element of type `A` for which the Right and Left identities hold true.

```ts
import { Monoid } from 'fp-ts/Monoid'

/** number `Monoid` under addition */
const MonoidSum: Monoid<number> = {
  concat: (first, second) => first + second,
  empty: 0
}

/** number `Monoid` under multiplication */
const MonoidProduct: Monoid<number> = {
  concat: (first, second) => first * second,
  empty: 1
}

const MonoidString: Monoid<string> = {
  concat: (first, second) => first + second,
  empty: ''
}

/** boolean monoid under conjunction */
const MonoidAll: Monoid<boolean> = {
  concat: (first, second) => first && second,
  empty: true
}

/** boolean monoid under disjunction */
const MonoidAny: Monoid<boolean> = {
  concat: (first, second) => first || second,
  empty: false
}
```

**Quiz**. In the semigroup section we have seen how the type `ReadonlyArray<string>` admits a `Semigroup` instance:

```ts
import { Semigroup } from 'fp-ts/Semigroup'

const Semigroup: Semigroup<ReadonlyArray<string>> = {
  concat: (first, second) => first.concat(second)
}
```

Can you find the `unit` for this semigroup? If so, can we generalize the result not just for `ReadonlyArray<string>` but `ReadonlyArray<A>` as well?

**Quiz** (more complex). Prove that given a monoid, there can only be one unit.

The consequence of the previous proof is that there can be only one unit per monoid, once we find one we can stop searching.

We have seen how each semigroup was a magma, but not every magma was a semigroup. In the same way, each monoid is a semigroup, but not every semigroup is a monoid.

**Example**

Let's consider the following example:

```ts
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import { intercalate } from 'fp-ts/Semigroup'
import * as S from 'fp-ts/string'

const SemigroupIntercalate = pipe(S.Semigroup, intercalate('|'))

console.log(S.Semigroup.concat('a', 'b')) // => 'ab'
console.log(SemigroupIntercalate.concat('a', 'b')) // => 'a|b'
console.log(SemigroupIntercalate.concat('a', '')) // => 'a|'
```

Note how for this Semigroup there's no such `empty` value of type `string` such as `concat(a, empty) = a`.

And now one final, slightly more "exotic" example, involving functions:

**Example**

An **endomorphism** is a function whose input and output type is the same:

```ts
type Endomorphism<A> = (a: A) => A
```

Given a type `A`, all endomorphisms defined on `A` are a monoid, such as:

- the `concat` operation is the usual function composition
- the unit, our `empty` value is the identity function

```ts
import { Endomorphism, flow, identity } from 'fp-ts/function'
import { Monoid } from 'fp-ts/Monoid'

export const getEndomorphismMonoid = <A>(): Monoid<Endomorphism<A>> => ({
  concat: flow,
  empty: identity
})
```

**Note**: The `identity` function has one, and only one possible implementation:

```ts
const identity = (a: A) => a
```

Whatever value we pass in input, it gives us the same value in output.

<!--
TODO:
We can start having a small taste of the importance of the `identity` function. While apparently useless per se, this function is vital to define a monoid for functions, in this case, endomorphisms. In fact, _doing nothing_, being _empty_ or _neutral_ is a tremendously valuable property to have when it comes to composition and we can think of the `identity` function as the number `0` of functions.
-->

## The `concatAll` function

One great property of monoids, compared to semigrops, is that the concatenation of multiple elements becomes even easier: it is not necessary anymore to provide an initial value.

```ts
import { concatAll } from 'fp-ts/Monoid'
import * as S from 'fp-ts/string'
import * as N from 'fp-ts/number'
import * as B from 'fp-ts/boolean'

console.log(concatAll(N.MonoidSum)([1, 2, 3, 4])) // => 10
console.log(concatAll(N.MonoidProduct)([1, 2, 3, 4])) // => 24
console.log(concatAll(S.Monoid)(['a', 'b', 'c'])) // => 'abc'
console.log(concatAll(B.MonoidAll)([true, false, true])) // => false
console.log(concatAll(B.MonoidAny)([true, false, true])) // => true
```

**Quiz**. Why is the initial value not needed anymore?

## Product monoid

As we have already seen with semigroups, it is possible to define a monoid instance for a `struct` if we are able to define a monoid instance for each of its fields.

**Example**

```ts
import { Monoid, struct } from 'fp-ts/Monoid'
import * as N from 'fp-ts/number'

type Point = {
  readonly x: number
  readonly y: number
}

const Monoid: Monoid<Point> = struct({
  x: N.MonoidSum,
  y: N.MonoidSum
})
```

**Note**. There is a combinator similar to `struct` that works with tuples: `tuple`.

```ts
import { Monoid, tuple } from 'fp-ts/Monoid'
import * as N from 'fp-ts/number'

type Point = readonly [number, number]

const Monoid: Monoid<Point> = tuple(N.MonoidSum, N.MonoidSum)
```

**Quiz**. Is it possible to define a "free monoid" for a generic type `A`?
