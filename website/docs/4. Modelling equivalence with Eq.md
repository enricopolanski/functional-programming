# Modelling equivalence with `Eq`

Yet again, we can model the notion of equality.

_Equivalence relations_ capture the concept of _equality_ of elements of the same type. The concept of an _equivalence relation_ can be implemented in TypeScript with the following interface:

```ts
interface Eq<A> {
  readonly equals: (first: A, second: A) => boolean
}
```

Intuitively:

- if `equals(x, y) = true` then we say `x` and `y` are equal
- if `equals(x, y) = false` then we say `x` and `y` are different

**Example**

This is an instance of `Eq` for the `number` type:

```ts
import { Eq } from 'fp-ts/Eq'
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'

const EqNumber: Eq<number> = {
  equals: (first, second) => first === second
}

pipe(EqNumber.equals(1, 1), console.log) // => true
pipe(EqNumber.equals(1, 2), console.log) // => false
```

The following laws have to hold true:

1. **Reflexivity**: `equals(x, x) === true`, for every `x` in `A`
2. **Symmetry**: `equals(x, y) === equals(y, x)`, for every `x`, `y` in `A`
3. **Transitivity**: if `equals(x, y) === true` and `equals(y, z) === true`, then `equals(x, z) === true`, for every `x`, `y`, `z` in `A`

**Quiz**. Would a combinator `reverse: <A>(E: Eq<A>) => Eq<A>` make sense?

**Quiz**. Would a combinator `not: <A>(E: Eq<A>) => Eq<A>` make sense?

```ts
import { Eq } from 'fp-ts/Eq'

export const not = <A>(E: Eq<A>): Eq<A> => ({
  equals: (first, second) => !E.equals(first, second)
})
```

**Example**

Let's see the first example of the usage of the `Eq` abstraction by defining a function `elem` that checks whether a given value is an element of `ReadonlyArray`.

```ts
import { Eq } from 'fp-ts/Eq'
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as N from 'fp-ts/number'

// returns `true` if the element `a` is included in the list `as`
const elem = <A>(E: Eq<A>) => (a: A) => (as: ReadonlyArray<A>): boolean =>
  as.some((e) => E.equals(a, e))

pipe([1, 2, 3], elem(N.Eq)(2), console.log) // => true
pipe([1, 2, 3], elem(N.Eq)(4), console.log) // => false
```

Why would we not use the native `includes` Array method?

```ts
console.log([1, 2, 3].includes(2)) // => true
console.log([1, 2, 3].includes(4)) // => false
```

Let's define some `Eq` instance for more complex types.

```ts
import { Eq } from 'fp-ts/Eq'

type Point = {
  readonly x: number
  readonly y: number
}

const EqPoint: Eq<Point> = {
  equals: (first, second) => first.x === second.x && first.y === second.y
}

console.log(EqPoint.equals({ x: 1, y: 2 }, { x: 1, y: 2 })) // => true
console.log(EqPoint.equals({ x: 1, y: 2 }, { x: 1, y: -2 })) // => false
```

and check the results of `elem` and `includes`

```ts
const points: ReadonlyArray<Point> = [
  { x: 0, y: 0 },
  { x: 1, y: 1 },
  { x: 2, y: 2 }
]

const search: Point = { x: 1, y: 1 }

console.log(points.includes(search)) // => false :(
console.log(pipe(points, elem(EqPoint)(search))) // => true :)
```

**Quiz** (JavaScript). Why does the `includes` method returns `false`?

-> See the [answer here](quiz-answers/javascript-includes.md)

Abstracting the concept of equality is of paramount importance, especially in a language like JavaScript where some data types do not offer handy APIs for checking user-defined equality.

The JavaScript native `Set` datatype suffers by the same issue:

```ts
type Point = {
  readonly x: number
  readonly y: number
}

const points: Set<Point> = new Set([{ x: 0, y: 0 }])

points.add({ x: 0, y: 0 })

console.log(points)
// => Set { { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 0, y: 0 } }
```

Given the fact that `Set` uses `===` ("strict equality") for comparing values, `points` now contains **two identical copies** of `{ x: 0, y: 0 }`, a result we definitely did not want. Thus it is convenient to define a new API to add an element to a `Set`, one that leverages the `Eq` abstraction.

**Quiz**. What would be the signature of this API?

Does `EqPoint` require too much boilerplate? The good news is that theory offers us yet again the possibility of implementing an `Eq` instance for a struct like `Point` if we are able to define an `Eq` instance for each of its fields.

Conveniently the `fp-ts/Eq` module exports a `struct` combinator:

```ts
import { Eq, struct } from 'fp-ts/Eq'
import * as N from 'fp-ts/number'

type Point = {
  readonly x: number
  readonly y: number
}

const EqPoint: Eq<Point> = struct({
  x: N.Eq,
  y: N.Eq
})
```

**Note**. Like for Semigroup, we aren't limited to `struct`-like data types, we also have combinators for working with tuples: `tuple`

```ts
import { Eq, tuple } from 'fp-ts/Eq'
import * as N from 'fp-ts/number'

type Point = readonly [number, number]

const EqPoint: Eq<Point> = tuple(N.Eq, N.Eq)

console.log(EqPoint.equals([1, 2], [1, 2])) // => true
console.log(EqPoint.equals([1, 2], [1, -2])) // => false
```

There are other combinators exported by `fp-ts`, here we can see a combinator that allows us to derive an `Eq` instance for `ReadonlyArray`s.

```ts
import { Eq, tuple } from 'fp-ts/Eq'
import * as N from 'fp-ts/number'
import * as RA from 'fp-ts/ReadonlyArray'

type Point = readonly [number, number]

const EqPoint: Eq<Point> = tuple(N.Eq, N.Eq)

const EqPoints: Eq<ReadonlyArray<Point>> = RA.getEq(EqPoint)
```

Similarly to Semigroups, it is possible to define more than one `Eq` instance for the same given type. Suppose we have modeled a `User` with the following type:

```ts
type User = {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
}
```

we can define a "standard" `Eq<User>` instance using the `struct` combinator:

```ts
import { Eq, struct } from 'fp-ts/Eq'
import * as N from 'fp-ts/number'
import * as S from 'fp-ts/string'

type User = {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
}

const EqStandard: Eq<User> = struct({
  id: N.Eq,
  name: S.Eq
})
```

Several languages, even pure functional languages like Haskell, do not allow to have more than one `Eq` instance per data type. But we may have different contexts where the meaning of `User` equality might differ. One common context is where two `User`s are equal if their `id` field is equal.

```ts
/** two users are equal if their `id` fields are equal */
const EqID: Eq<User> = {
  equals: (first, second) => N.Eq.equals(first.id, second.id)
}
```

Now that we made an abstract concept concrete by representing it as a data structure, we can programmatically manipulate `Eq` instances like we do with other data structures. Let's see an example.

**Example**. Rather than manually defining `EqId` we can use the combinator `contramap`: given an instance `Eq<A>` and a function from `B` to `A`, we can derive an `Eq<B>`

```ts
import { Eq, struct, contramap } from 'fp-ts/Eq'
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as N from 'fp-ts/number'
import * as S from 'fp-ts/string'

type User = {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
}

const EqStandard: Eq<User> = struct({
  id: N.Eq,
  name: S.Eq
})

const EqID: Eq<User> = pipe(
  N.Eq,
  contramap((user: User) => user.id)
)

console.log(
  EqStandard.equals({ id: 1, name: 'Giulio' }, { id: 1, name: 'Giulio Canti' })
) // => false (because the `name` property differs)

console.log(
  EqID.equals({ id: 1, name: 'Giulio' }, { id: 1, name: 'Giulio Canti' })
) // => true (even though the `name` property differs)

console.log(EqID.equals({ id: 1, name: 'Giulio' }, { id: 2, name: 'Giulio' }))
// => false (even though the `name` property is equal)
```

**Quiz**. Given a data type `A`, is it possible to define a `Semigroup<Eq<A>>`? What could it represent?

## Modeling ordering relations with `Ord`

In the previous chapter regarding `Eq` we were dealing with the concept of **equality**. In this one we'll deal with the concept of **ordering**.

The concept of a total order relation can be implemented in TypeScript as following:

```ts
import { Eq } from 'fp-ts/lib/Eq'

type Ordering = -1 | 0 | 1

interface Ord<A> extends Eq<A> {
  readonly compare: (x: A, y: A) => Ordering
}
```

Resulting in:

- `x < y` if and only if `compare(x, y) = -1`
- `x = y` if and only if `compare(x, y) = 0`
- `x > y` if and only if `compare(x, y) = 1`

**Example**

Let's try to define an `Ord` instance for the type `number`:

```ts
import { Ord } from 'fp-ts/Ord'

const OrdNumber: Ord<number> = {
  equals: (first, second) => first === second,
  compare: (first, second) => (first < second ? -1 : first > second ? 1 : 0)
}
```

The following laws have to hold true:

1. **Reflexivity**: `compare(x, x) <= 0`, for every `x` in `A`
2. **Antisymmetry**: if `compare(x, y) <= 0` and `compare(y, x) <= 0` then `x = y`, for every `x`, `y` in `A`
3. **Transitivity**: if `compare(x, y) <= 0` and `compare(y, z) <= 0` then `compare(x, z) <= 0`, for every `x`, `y`, `z` in `A`

`compare` has also to be compatible with the `equals` operation from `Eq`:

`compare(x, y) === 0` if and only if `equals(x, y) === true`, for every `x`, `y` in `A`

**Note**. `equals` can be derived from `compare` in the following way:

```ts
equals: (first, second) => compare(first, second) === 0
```

In fact the `fp-ts/Ord` module exports a handy helper `fromCompare` which allows us to define an `Ord` instance simply by supplying the `compare` function:

```ts
import { Ord, fromCompare } from 'fp-ts/Ord'

const OrdNumber: Ord<number> = fromCompare((first, second) =>
  first < second ? -1 : first > second ? 1 : 0
)
```

**Quiz**. Is it possible to define an `Ord` instance for the game Rock-Paper-Scissor where `move1 <= move2` if `move2` beats `move1`?

Let's see a practical usage of an `Ord` instance by defining a `sort` function which orders the elements of a `ReadonlyArray`.

```ts
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as N from 'fp-ts/number'
import { Ord } from 'fp-ts/Ord'

export const sort = <A>(O: Ord<A>) => (
  as: ReadonlyArray<A>
): ReadonlyArray<A> => as.slice().sort(O.compare)

pipe([3, 1, 2], sort(N.Ord), console.log) // => [1, 2, 3]
```

**Quiz** (JavaScript). Why does the implementation leverages the native Array `slice` method?

Let's see another `Ord` pratical usage by defining a `min` function that returns the smallest of two values:

```ts
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as N from 'fp-ts/number'
import { Ord } from 'fp-ts/Ord'

const min = <A>(O: Ord<A>) => (second: A) => (first: A): A =>
  O.compare(first, second) === 1 ? second : first

pipe(2, min(N.Ord)(1), console.log) // => 1
```

## Dual Ordering

In the same way we could invert the `concat` operation to obtain the `dual semigroup` using the `reverse` combinator, we can invert the `compare` operation to get the dual ordering.

Let's define the `reverse` combinator for `Ord`:

```ts
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as N from 'fp-ts/number'
import { fromCompare, Ord } from 'fp-ts/Ord'

export const reverse = <A>(O: Ord<A>): Ord<A> =>
  fromCompare((first, second) => O.compare(second, first))
```

A usage example for `reverse` is obtaining a `max` function from the `min` one:

```ts
import { flow, pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as N from 'fp-ts/number'
import { Ord, reverse } from 'fp-ts/Ord'

const min = <A>(O: Ord<A>) => (second: A) => (first: A): A =>
  O.compare(first, second) === 1 ? second : first

// const max: <A>(O: Ord<A>) => (second: A) => (first: A) => A
const max = flow(reverse, min)

pipe(2, max(N.Ord)(1), console.log) // => 2
```

The **totality** of ordering (meaning that given any `x` and `y`, one of the two conditions needs to hold true: `x <= y` or `y <= z`) may appear obvious when speaking about numbers, but that's not always the case. Let's see a slightly more complex scenario:

```ts
type User = {
  readonly name: string
  readonly age: number
}
```

It's not really clear when a `User` is "smaller or equal" than another `User`.

How can we define an `Ord<User>` instance?

That depends on the context, but a possible choice might be ordering `User`s by their age:

```ts
import * as N from 'fp-ts/number'
import { fromCompare, Ord } from 'fp-ts/Ord'

type User = {
  readonly name: string
  readonly age: number
}

const byAge: Ord<User> = fromCompare((first, second) =>
  N.Ord.compare(first.age, second.age)
)
```

Again we can get rid of some boilerplate using the `contramap` combinatorL given an `Ord<A>` instance and a function from `B` to `A`, it is possible to derive `Ord<B>`:

```ts
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as N from 'fp-ts/number'
import { contramap, Ord } from 'fp-ts/Ord'

type User = {
  readonly name: string
  readonly age: number
}

const byAge: Ord<User> = pipe(
  N.Ord,
  contramap((_: User) => _.age)
)
```

We can get the youngest of two `User`s using the previously defined `min` function.

```ts
// const getYounger: (second: User) => (first: User) => User
const getYounger = min(byAge)

pipe(
  { name: 'Guido', age: 50 },
  getYounger({ name: 'Giulio', age: 47 }),
  console.log
) // => { name: 'Giulio', age: 47 }
```

**Quiz**. In the `fp-ts/ReadonlyMap` module the following API is exposed:

```ts
/**
 * Get a sorted `ReadonlyArray` of the keys contained in a `ReadonlyMap`.
 */
declare const keys: <K>(
  O: Ord<K>
) => <A>(m: ReadonlyMap<K, A>) => ReadonlyArray<K>
```

why does this API requires an instance for `Ord<K>`?

Let's finally go back to the very first issue: defining two semigroups `SemigroupMin` and `SemigroupMax` for types different than `number`:

```ts
import { Semigroup } from 'fp-ts/Semigroup'

const SemigroupMin: Semigroup<number> = {
  concat: (first, second) => Math.min(first, second)
}

const SemigroupMax: Semigroup<number> = {
  concat: (first, second) => Math.max(first, second)
}
```

Now that we have the `Ord` abstraction we can do it:

```ts
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as N from 'fp-ts/number'
import { Ord, contramap } from 'fp-ts/Ord'
import { Semigroup } from 'fp-ts/Semigroup'

export const min = <A>(O: Ord<A>): Semigroup<A> => ({
  concat: (first, second) => (O.compare(first, second) === 1 ? second : first)
})

export const max = <A>(O: Ord<A>): Semigroup<A> => ({
  concat: (first, second) => (O.compare(first, second) === 1 ? first : second)
})

type User = {
  readonly name: string
  readonly age: number
}

const byAge: Ord<User> = pipe(
  N.Ord,
  contramap((_: User) => _.age)
)

console.log(
  min(byAge).concat({ name: 'Guido', age: 50 }, { name: 'Giulio', age: 47 })
) // => { name: 'Giulio', age: 47 }
console.log(
  max(byAge).concat({ name: 'Guido', age: 50 }, { name: 'Giulio', age: 47 })
) // => { name: 'Guido', age: 50 }
```

**Example**

Let's recap all of this with one final example (adapted from [Fantas, Eel, and Specification 4: Semigroup](http://www.tomharding.me/2017/03/13/fantas-eel-and-specification-4/)).

Suppose we need to build a system where, in a database, there are records of customers implemented in the following way:

```ts
interface Customer {
  readonly name: string
  readonly favouriteThings: ReadonlyArray<string>
  readonly registeredAt: number // since epoch
  readonly lastUpdatedAt: number // since epoch
  readonly hasMadePurchase: boolean
}
```

For some reason, there might be duplicate records for the same person.

We need a merging strategy. Well, that's Semigroup's bread and butter!

```ts
import * as B from 'fp-ts/boolean'
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as N from 'fp-ts/number'
import { contramap } from 'fp-ts/Ord'
import * as RA from 'fp-ts/ReadonlyArray'
import { max, min, Semigroup, struct } from 'fp-ts/Semigroup'
import * as S from 'fp-ts/string'

interface Customer {
  readonly name: string
  readonly favouriteThings: ReadonlyArray<string>
  readonly registeredAt: number // since epoch
  readonly lastUpdatedAt: number // since epoch
  readonly hasMadePurchase: boolean
}

const SemigroupCustomer: Semigroup<Customer> = struct({
  // keep the longer name
  name: max(pipe(N.Ord, contramap(S.size))),
  // accumulate things
  favouriteThings: RA.getSemigroup<string>(),
  // keep the least recent date
  registeredAt: min(N.Ord),
  // keep the most recent date
  lastUpdatedAt: max(N.Ord),
  // boolean semigroup under disjunction
  hasMadePurchase: B.SemigroupAny
})

console.log(
  SemigroupCustomer.concat(
    {
      name: 'Giulio',
      favouriteThings: ['math', 'climbing'],
      registeredAt: new Date(2018, 1, 20).getTime(),
      lastUpdatedAt: new Date(2018, 2, 18).getTime(),
      hasMadePurchase: false
    },
    {
      name: 'Giulio Canti',
      favouriteThings: ['functional programming'],
      registeredAt: new Date(2018, 1, 22).getTime(),
      lastUpdatedAt: new Date(2018, 2, 9).getTime(),
      hasMadePurchase: true
    }
  )
)
/*
{ name: 'Giulio Canti',
  favouriteThings: [ 'math', 'climbing', 'functional programming' ],
  registeredAt: 1519081200000, // new Date(2018, 1, 20).getTime()
  lastUpdatedAt: 1521327600000, // new Date(2018, 2, 18).getTime()
  hasMadePurchase: true
}
*/
```

**Quiz**. Given a type `A` is it possible to define a `Semigroup<Ord<A>>` instance? What could it possibly represent?
